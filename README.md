# who’s who in rock-art (wwr)

the changing world of rock-art studies  
people, what they do and where

## introduction

The Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici (CCSP) published the first edition of “Who’s Who in Rock Art” in 1985. There was another in 1996. Ariela Fradkin Anati edited both. A third edition dedicated to Ariela celebrates the founding of CCSP in 1964.

There were 285 researchers in the 1995 edition and 305 in that of 1996. Some colleagues are no longer with us. Even so, our number grew. Today over a thousand people are finding, working on and publishing rock-art. As before, the idea is to foster networking between people interested in the marvel.

Entries note research interests, continents, periods and projects.

Any rock art researcher may submit details. Enthusiasts are welcome! No publishing fees.

Feel free to contact the editors or see our web pages.

The printed version will be available through CCSP and Amazon for €15 (plus shipping). People with entries can order a copy from CCSP for €10 (plus shipping) or pre-order for €7 (plus shipping).

The third edition will be a joint venture of CCSP, Le Orme dell’Uomo and Carabà editions Milano.

A review can only take place after collecting information. In 1984, António Guerreiro adopted dBase, a relational database management system. Now, wwr3 uses [`YAML`](http://yaml.org/){:target="_blank"} to gather and shape data. Humans and computers can read YAML. It is convertible to other formats like [`JSON`](http://json.org/){:target="_blank"} and [`XML`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML){:target="_blank"}. [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL){:target="_blank"} database engines like [`SQLite`](http://yaml.org/){:target="_blank"} and [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/){:target="_blank"} can store and query JSON.
