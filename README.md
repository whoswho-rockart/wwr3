# who’s who in rock-art (wwr)

the changing world of rock-art studies  
people, what they do and where

## introduction

The Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici (CCSP) published the first
edition of “Who’s Who in Rock Art” in 1985 followed by another in 1996.
Ariela Fradkin Anati edited both of these. A third edition dedicated to
Ariela celebrates the founding of CCSP in 1964.

CCSP will present the third edition of “who’s who in rock-art” (wwr3)
at the international rock art congress “On the Shoulders of Giants”
(29 August to 2 September 2018, Boario Terme, Valcamonica, Italy). The
congress marks fifty years since the first Valcamonica Symposium and
thirty years of the Cooperativa Archeologica «Le Orme dell’Uomo».

There were 285 researchers in the 1995 edition and 305 in that of 1996.
Since then, some colleagues are no longer with us. Even so, our number
grew. Today there are over a thousand people finding, working on and
publishing rock-art. As in previous issues, the idea is to foster
networking between people interested in rock art.

Entries will note research areas and interests, chronology, and
bibliography. There will be a web app designed for offline access. The
same information will appear in print with a bibliography limited to
five per person.

Any rock art researcher may submit an entry. Aficionados and amateurs
welcome! There are no fees for publishing entries.

Feel free to contact the editors or see our pages at GitHub and
WordPress.

A review can only take place after collecting information. In 1984,
António Guerreiro adopted dBase, a relational database management system.
Now, wwr3 uses YAML ([`yaml.org`](http://yaml.org/)) to collect and shape
information. YAML is a treelike data serialisation language discernible
to both humans and computers. It is convertible to other formats like
JSON ([`JavaScript Object Notation`](http://json.org/)) and XML
([`Extensible Markup Language`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)).
SQL ([`Structured Query Language`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL))
database engines like SQLite ([`sqlite.org`](http://yaml.org/)) and
PostgreSQL ([`postgresql.org`](https://www.postgresql.org/)) can store
and query JSON.
