# Who’s Who in Rock-art (wwr)

the changing world of rock-art studies  
people, what they do and where

## introduction

The Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici (CCSP) published the
first edition of “Who’s Who in Rock Art” in 1985 followed by
another in 1996. A third edition now underway, dedicated to
Ariela Fradkin Anati, who edited the previous two, celebrates
the founding of CCSP in 1964.

CCSP will present the third edition of “Who’s who in rock-art”
(wwr3) at the 2018 IFRAO congress, “On the Shoulders of Giants”
(31 August to 2 September, Boario Terme, Valcamonica, Italy),
which commemorates fifty years since the first Valcamonica
Symposium and thirty years of the Cooperativa Archeologica
«Le Orme dell’Uomo» and the International Federation of Rock
Art Organizations (IFRAO).

There were 285 researchers in the 1995 edition and 305 in that
of 1996. Since then, some colleagues are no longer with us.
Even so, our number grew and today there are over a thousand
people finding, working on and publishing rock-art. As in
previous issues, the idea is to foster cooperation between
rock-art colleagues around the world.

Entries will note research areas and interests, chronology, and
bibliography. There will be a web app, which can be downloaded
and accessed offline. The same information will appear in print,
but the bibliography limited to five publications per person.

Any rock art researcher may submit an entry, irrespective
academic affiliation—aficionados and amateurs welcome!
There are no fees for publishing entries.

Feel free to contact the editors by email and Skype, or on
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, or see our pages at GitHub
and WordPress.

The printed version will be available through CCSP and Amazon
for €10 (plus shipping) or €7 at the congress. People with
entries can get it from CCSP for €7 (plus shipping) or €5 at
the congress.

The third edition will be a joint venture of IFRAO, CCSP,
Le Orme dell’Uomo and Carabà editions Milano.

A review can only take place after collecting information.In 1984,
António Guerreiro adopted dBase, a relational database management system.
Now, wwr3 uses YAML ([`yaml.org`](http://yaml.org/)) to collect and shape
information. YAML is a treelike data serialisation language discernible
to both humans and computers. It is convertible to formats like JSON
([`JavaScript Object Notation`](http://json.org/)) and XML
([`Extensible Markup Language`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)).
SQL ([`Structured Query Language`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL))
database engines like SQLite ([`sqlite.org`](http://yaml.org/)) and
PostgreSQL ([`postgresql.org`](https://www.postgresql.org/)) can store
and query JSON.

Please copy and complete wwr3 questionnaire and bibliography templates and
send them to [`whoswho.rockart (at) gmail.com`](mailto:whoswho.rockart).
